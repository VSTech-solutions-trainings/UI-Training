Diff between class vs functional components

life cycle methods

These are all in-built functions which will be called in the behind
Basically there are three important life cycle methods
1) constructor
2) componentDidMount
3) componentDidUpdate
4) componentWillUnmount

functional components can also achieve life cycle methods functionality using a hook called useEffect

1) state management - useState

useState is a hook to maintain the state of a component, by using normal variables react will not re-render.

syntax

const [age, setAge] = useState(initialValue)

---- useRef

useRef will not re-render the component, it remembers the previous initialValue

whereas when a value changes in useState, the component will be re-rendered.

createPortal
we can inject the component inside any element.

props drilling

- Even though the component doesn't require the values we have to send it as props so that it children can use it
- This is called props drilling

To avoid this situation we have a hook called useContext.

Next class - useContext, useReducer, use
