Redux - This is not in-built react feature. This is a third party library.
This is used for state management.

Redux Core Concepts
- Store ( This is a centralized object where state lives)
- Action - This is a plain object which determines what data/action should be done inside a Store
- Reducer - This is a just plain JS function which takes current state and action and returns a new state

- Dispatch - This is used to Dispatch some actions to the store.
- Selector - This is also a JS function to read state from the store.

npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux - This will do the store setup
npm install react-redux - This is used for connecting react to the redux
