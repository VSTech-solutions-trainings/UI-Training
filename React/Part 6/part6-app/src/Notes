what are side effects ?

Actions/Tasks which are performed outside of react rendering world, that is called a side effect.

use cases:
1) fetching data from an API
2) logging
3) Websocket, events
4) DOM updates 

Life Cycle methods inside class

1) constructor

2) componentDidMount
3) componentDidUpdate
4) componentWillUnMount

we can replicate same life cycle methods inside functional components using a hook called useEffect (this is mainly used for side effects)

syntax of useEffect

useEffect(() => {
  // side effect

  return () => {
  // clean up 
  }
}, [dependecies])

rules of useEffect

1) useEffect should not be written inside a functional
2) we can either pass dependecies nor we can ignore it
3) if we ignore it, then useEffect will be called whenever there is an update/modify of a state variable

4) if we don't pass any dependecies array, useEffect will be triggered every time when there is a rendering of that component.
5) if we pass empty dependecies [] - then it will be called only once.
