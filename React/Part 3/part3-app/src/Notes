.gitignore - to ignore the files to be committed to git
React Fragments - to avoid unnecessary DOM nodes on the UI
Syntax - <></>
props - properties of the react component which is nothing but a javascript object - in simpler way we can use object destructuring

children - the content which is embedded inside the custom component

data flow in react - always one way data binding (parent - child), but there are some ways we can implmenet two way data binding

render props - ? since react is always one way binding, we pass functions as props to manipulate parent's data.
