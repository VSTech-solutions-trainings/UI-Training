--- Installation of react router

npm install react-router-dom

In order to use routes for the application, we have to wrap the App component with BrowserRouter

Then we have to define the routes using Routes and Route component

Then we have to define the links to which the routes should be linked using Link

Diff btwn Link and NavLink -NavLink will provided a className to whic we can add styling to the active link

useNavigate is a hook which we can use to navigate to any route

syntax : const navigate = useNavigate()
<button onClick={() => navigate("/learn")}>Back to learn</button>

-- wild card routes

always place wild card routes at the last
