-- what is a TypeScript ? This is used for static typing and to detect early defects/bugs in the code.

browsers will not support TypeScript. Browsers supports only JavaScript, so we have to convert/transpile ts code to js code

we need TypeScript compiler/transpiler

Below command is used to install TypeScript

npm install -g TypeScript

tsc --version - to check the version of tsc

we can transpile a ts file to js file using tsc filename.ts
This will create a filename.js file

In large project we can configure the tsc using a config file (tsconfig.json)

tsconfig file will be created using tsc --init

tsc --watch (This is to watch all the changes and compile the code)

Basic types of TypeScript

1. JavaScript types - primitive, non-primitives

Type assignment vs Type inference

    let age: number = 12 //This is Type assignment

    let age = 12 // Type inference

We can create our own types using type alias

    type age = number 

    let personAge: age = 12;

any type

let personDetails: any = 12;
personDetails = 'Mike'

any will not restrict the type of the variable( DO NOT OVER USE any type)

Union type 

    let personDetails: number | string;

Array type

    let personAge: string[] = ["1", "2", "3"];

    let newNumber = "4";

    personAge.push(newNumber);

Tuples type 

    let personAge: [number, string]

    personAge = [22, 'Mike']
