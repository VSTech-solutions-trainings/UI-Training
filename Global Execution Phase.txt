------- How JS runs in the behind with a synchronous flow ?----

Whenever a browser sees a JS file - it will create a Global Execution Environment

Global Execution Environment  has 2 phases - 1) Memory allocation phase 
					     2) Code execution phase

1)Memory allocation phase --

JS engine skims through top-bottom and finds all the variables including functions - allocate some space to these with default values in key-value pairs( a: undefined) (function: fn: {...})

2) Code execution phase --

top-bottom --> and assign values -- if it finds any other function - it will create another Global execution Environment
